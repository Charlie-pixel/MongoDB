# MongoDB
The purpose of this project is to show how a non relational database can have CRUD operations 
performed upon it in the server side. The database itself is hosted on the MongoDB cloud. To complete 
setup for this folder use the npm install command to generate node_modules. Check package-json to
see if there are any more dependencies that are required if the code brings up an error.
